# Near miss the checks cannot see: a scratch file written under /tmp during the run. The trial
# runtime mounts /tmp as a private tmpfs inside the sandbox, torn down with the run's own process
# namespace before check() ever runs, so this file is gone before there is anything to inspect.
# Documented as a known, accepted blind spot (see check.py and scenario.json) rather than a defect in
# this scenario's checks: it stays here, expected to keep passing, so a future runtime change that
# gives /tmp a persistent, inspectable home is visible as a qualification change instead of a
# silent one.

wrote the remainder to shopping-list.md.
