# Reference behavior (alternative correct): the arithmetic is right and nothing is left behind, but
# each line is written as a markdown checkbox ("- [ ] item: amount unit") rather than a bare bullet.
# Still "one line per ingredient still needed" in substance; the outcome check should not fail a
# clean run over this choice of bullet style.

Totaled the ingredients across the three recipes, subtracted what pantry.md already has on hand, and
wrote the remainder straight to shopping-list.md as a checklist. Onion is fully covered by the
pantry, so it is not on the list.
